    <h1>LORE</h1>

    <p>Lore, or the story of FORSAKEN, is meant to show why and how the events of Forsaken are taking place.This page is a list of pages that are only meant to showcase the lore, not the gameplay, of Forsaken. For lore on in-game characters, check the NPC, Killer, and Survivor pages.</p>

    <p>The lore of FORSAKEN is still developing, and can be scrapped or changed at any moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Killers">
        <h1>KILLERS</h1>
        <h3>1x1x1x1</h3>
        <p>In the Roblox community, 1x1x1x1 was long rumored to be a hacker following the account's creation on October 25, 2007. The account, however, was originally created by Shedletsky, Roblox's former Creative Director, as part of the platform's early lore. According to this lore, the Necrobloxicon, a cursed book within the mythos, describes 1x1x1x1, also known as "The Adversary," as an entity from the fourth dimension who seeks to destroy Roblox for existing solely in three dimensions. The entity was ultimately imprisoned by 2x2 at the dawn of time. In the FORSAKEN lore, 1x1x1x1 is a physical manifestation of Shedletsky, who is also a Survivor in the game, born from his suppressed hatred and hell-bent on destroying Shedletsky, along with his allies.</p>

        <h3>c00lkidd</h3>
        <p>c00lkidd in FORSAKEN is based on the alternate account of the infamous Roblox hacker 007n7. He used this account to create the "c00lgui," the main panel for carrying out exploits, and the Roblox group "Team c00lkidd." From 2014 to 2016, c00lkidd and his group vandalized games like Work at a Pizza Place and Natural Disaster Survival, spreading the phrase "Team c00lkidd, join today!" to grow their following. After 007n7's main and alternate accounts were terminated, the group split, leading to spin-offs such as Team c00lkidd 2 and Team c00lkidd 4, which later migrated to tеаm c00lkidd, now active with around 6,000 members. Learn more about him here. In FORSAKEN lore, c00lkidd is the 10-year-old adopted son of 007n7, a Survivor. 007n7 adopted him after he was left at his doorstep. After receiving the c00lgui from his adoptive father, which proved disastrous, he unleashed chaos throughout Roblox, particularly in Work at a Pizza Place, before disappearing. Both were later forsaken by The Spectre, who now manipulates c00lkidd into believing he is simply playing games of tag.</p>

        <h3>John Doe</h3>
        <p>John Doe in FORSAKEN is based on the second account to join Roblox, created in 2005 as a test account by Roblox CEO David Baszucki. Despite the simple origin, the account became the center of a well-known Roblox urban legend claiming he and Jane Doe would return to destroy Roblox on March 18, 2017. More about that legend can be found here. His corruption is not based on the legend itself, but on a script showcased in a 2017 YouTube video that altered the exploiter into a John-Doe-like form, complete with a scripted killing arm, and worked in games with weak anti-cheat. In FORSAKEN, John Doe's lore is mostly unfinished, including his backstory, the reasons that led the defunct code to consume him, and how he arrived in FORSAKEN. As the husband of Jane Doe, an upcoming Survivor, he became corrupted after being fused with fragments of Roblox's old, defunct code. The mutation severely altered his body, causing new claws to form, black code to spread across his torso, and his right eye to turn red and glitch with code. Now energized by this corruption, he is programmed to exterminate all Survivors, including his wife once she enters the game.</p>

        <h3>Slasher</h3>
        <p>Slasher was introduced as a redesign of Jason to avoid copyright conflicts with the various rights holders of his main inspiration, Jason Voorhees, whose ownership is unusually fragmented. Rather than navigating the long process of securing permissions from multiple parties, the developers opted to redesign him, which was far easier. See the full reason here. Despite the changes, Slasher keeps the first name Jason and still draws clear inspiration from Jason Voorhees; his chase themes reference Friday the 13th, and his appearance is based on the version seen in Survive and Kill the Killers in Area 51. His gameplay remains mostly unchanged. In FORSAKEN lore, Slasher is a bacon-haired prisoner of war from the Roblox action-animated war film The Last Guest by ObliviousHD. After being captured, he was sent to Area 51 and subjected to brutal, inhumane experiments. During this time, he discovered the Necrobloxicon, a cursed book whose mysterious voice convinced him it was his mother. He later escaped alongside Jeff The Killer and Slenderman, continuing to commit acts of violence under the book’s influence.</p>

    <div class="Survivors">
        <h1>SURVIVORS</h1>
        <h3>Shedletsky</h3>
        <p>Shedletsky in FORSAKEN is based on the well-known Roblox player of the same name (or formerly known as Telamon). His full real name is John James Shedletsky, III, a retired Roblox Creative Director, Administrator, and the company's fourth-hired engineer. He developed important features such as character animations and the Roblox API, and created popular games including the classic and nostalgic Sword Fights on the Heights (SFOTH). Shedletsky is also the creator of the notorious 1x1x1x1 account, an infamous figure in Roblox lore and his fictional archenemy, who also appears as a Killer in FORSAKEN.</p>

        <h3>007n7</h3>
        <p>007n7 in FORSAKEN is based on the creator of the notorious Roblox hacker group "Team c00lkidd." He created c00lkidd as an alternate account and developed the "c00lgui" in 2014, which was used to disrupt some of the most loved Roblox games at the time, such as Work at a Pizza Place. In FORSAKEN lore, 007n7 is the adoptive father of c00lkidd. However, at some point while c00lkidd was under his care, c00lkidd had started hacking, which he used to wreak havoc, and eventually went missing (presumably forsakened), shown in 007n7's Milestone IV render.</p>

        <h3>Noob</h3>
        <p>Noob in FORSAKEN is based on one of the original Roblox default avatars used between 2005 and 2007. In modern Roblox culture, this avatar has become the iconic representation of the term "Noob" or "newbie," symbolizing new players within the game. In FORSAKEN lore, Noob, although a basic character, holds a very long and traumatic history. They once formed a close friendship with Guest 666, a bond that began positively but eventually deteriorated. The fallout grew hostile and violent, ending in a permanent separation. Though Noob later found new friends and attempted to move on, the trauma from Guest 666 persisted, ultimately leading to Noob's descent into the Forsaken realm.</p>

        <h3>Guest 1337</h3>
        <p>Guest 1337 is based on the main protagonist of ObliviousHD's animated series The Last Guest. Hailed as a Robloxian war hero, he was declared the Last Guest and joined the Roblox Army to battle the militarized, bacon-haired terrorist regime known as the Bacon Empire, which was responsible for the near-extinction of his kind. In the FORSAKEN universe, he ultimately perished during the final events of the first movie in The Last Guest series, sacrificing himself with a grenade to kill the Bacon General. This act of self-sacrifice led to his arrival in the FORSAKEN realm. Learn more about him here.</p>
